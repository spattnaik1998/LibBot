**Intent Classification with Confidence Scoring**:
```python
# GPT-4o analyzes user input and provides confidence metrics
{
    "intent": "buy",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "reasoning": "User explicitly mentions 'buy' and provides book titles",
    "extracted_books": [
        {"title": "Harry Potter", "quantity": 2},
        {"title": "Lord of the Rings", "quantity": 1}
    ]
}
```

**Dynamic Response Generation**:
- **Contextual Responses**: Tailored based on user history and current state
- **Error Recovery**: Intelligent handling of unclear or incomplete requests
- **Proactive Assistance**: Offers suggestions and alternatives when appropriate

### LangGraph Workflow Orchestration

#### 1. State Management
```python
class ChatbotState(BaseModel):
    user_id: int
    username: str
    current_agent: AgentState = AgentState.MASTER
    conversation_step: ConversationStep = ConversationStep.INITIAL
    user_message: str = ""
    agent_response: str = ""
    conversation_history: List[Dict[str, str]] = []
    selected_book: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    transaction_result: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
```

#### 2. Workflow Graph Definition
```python
workflow = StateGraph(ChatbotState)
workflow.add_node("master", self._master_node)
workflow.add_node("query", self._query_node) 
workflow.add_node("buy", self._buy_node)
workflow.add_node("credit", self._credit_node)

# Conditional routing from master agent
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "master",
    self._route_from_master,
    {
        "query": "query",
        "buy": "buy",
        "credit": "credit", 
        "end": END
    }
)
```

#### 3. Agent Communication Protocol
- **State Persistence**: Maintains context across agent transitions
- **Bidirectional Flow**: Agents can pass control back to master for follow-ups
- **Error Propagation**: Consistent error handling across all agents

### SQL Server Integration

#### 1. Connection Architecture
**PYODBC with Connection Resilience**:
```python
connection_strings = [
    f"Driver={{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}};Server={server};Database={db};Trusted_Connection=yes;",
    f"Driver={{SQL Server}};Server={server};Database={db};Trusted_Connection=yes;",
    # Multiple fallback options
]
```

#### 2. Transaction Management
**Atomic Multi-Book Purchase Example**:
```python
def buy_multiple_books_transaction(self, user_id: int, book_requests: List[Dict]):
    cursor = self.connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute("BEGIN TRANSACTION")
        
        # Validate all books exist and have sufficient quantity
        for book_req in book_requests:
            # Validation logic
            
        # Check user has sufficient credits
        total_cost = len(book_requests) * 20
        # Credit validation
        
        # Execute all purchases atomically
        for book_req in book_requests:
            cursor.execute("""
                UPDATE book_names SET Qty = Qty - ? WHERE title LIKE ?;
                UPDATE users SET available_credits = available_credits - 20 WHERE user_id = ?
            """, (book_req['quantity'], f"%{book_req['title']}%", user_id))
        
        cursor.execute("COMMIT TRANSACTION")
        return {"success": True, "details": transaction_details}
        
    except Exception as e:
        cursor.execute("ROLLBACK TRANSACTION") 
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
```

#### 3. Data Schema
```sql
-- Users table with credit system
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
    email NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    available_credits INT DEFAULT 100 NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME2 DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- Book inventory with quantity tracking
CREATE TABLE book_names (
    book_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    title NVARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    author NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    Qty INT DEFAULT 20 NOT NULL CHECK (Qty >= 0),
    created_at DATETIME2 DEFAULT GETDATE()
);
```

## üöÄ Key Technical Innovations

### 1. Conversational AI without Command Syntax
Traditional chatbots require specific commands. This system understands natural language:
- ‚ùå Old: "COMMAND: BUY Harry Potter QUANTITY: 2"  
- ‚úÖ New: "I'd like to get Harry Potter, maybe 2 copies?"

### 2. Multi-Book Atomic Transactions
Handles complex purchase scenarios with complete data integrity:
```python
# User: "I want Harry Potter: 2, Gatsby: 1, and Pride and Prejudice: 3"
# System processes all 6 books atomically - either all succeed or all fail
```

### 3. Intelligent Agent Routing
Master agent decides whether to:
- Handle the request directly (Q&A, help)
- Route to specialized agent (purchases, searches)
- Ask for clarification (unclear intent)

### 4. Context-Aware Responses
Each response considers:
- User's conversation history
- Current system state
- Available inventory
- User's credit balance
